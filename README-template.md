## My process
I used SASS for this challenge so that I will be able to split the challenge into three secions HEADER, MAIN, MAIN2 and FOOTER adding media queries was not stressful. I just had to go to each section and add the media query for the various breakpoints.

Also I used the max-width property so the site can be viewd on larger screens.

I also used Flexbox for the navigation and positioning inner elements.
and used Grid for the MAIN2 section which is the cards.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

** I want to really focus on mobile navigation(Sidevar) which am not really comfortable with how i come up with its development.
** Also I want to focus on image positioning. working with images for me is a bit harder, had to manipulate things to work.
** CSS grid is something I am still getting used to, I wish frontendMentor.io could include more grid challenges to help us get comfortable.
